## Self assessment

Since graduation, I have been engaged in the iOS development field, mostly in financial projects. In the future, I plan to further study the iOS field and dig into the iOS field. At the same time, I also want to learn about other related fields, such as hybrid development of front-end instant messaging, so as to broaden my horizon. Let oneself go further on technical principle diligently!

In my spare time, I also spare some time to write technology Blog. I will rearrange and share what I have learned in the way of taking notes, so that I can master what I have learned more firmly.
